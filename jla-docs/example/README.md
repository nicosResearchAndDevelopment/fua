# Example

## The Universe

["The Universe" (**TUNI**)](./theuniverse/README.md) as a (maybe good) [starting point](./universe/README.md) to explain
basic concepts of designing pieces of [data](../glossary/README.md#data) in a way (the _semantic_ one), so
provided [information](../glossary/README.md#information) makes sense.

At the beginning there is _one_ Universe, "The Universe" (**TUNI**).

As time goes by, there is _another_ Universe, the "Parallel Universe" (**PUNI**).

"The Universe" and the "Parallel Universe" are build on `fuas` ontology extension
["Universe" (**UNIV**, namespace/prefix `univ`)](../extension/universe/README.md).

But the story does not stop here - but combines "The Multiverse", populated by given universes
"The Universe" and the "Parallel Universe"...

```#the-universe, #tuni, #puni, #univ```

## Weather Station

["Weather Station""](./weatherstation/README.md) as a representative of small, easy understandable and
manageable [systems](../glossary/README.md#system).

[This example](./weatherstation/README.md) introduces the concepts
of [Subject](../glossary/README.md#subject)/[Property](../glossary/README.md#property),
[System](../glossary/README.md#system) and [Digital Twin](../glossary/README.md#digital-twin) and brings it to 
service by its instantiation, so in the end [it](./weatherstation/README.md) has an eye
on ["Internet of Things" (IoT), Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things).

## DataVerse "The Universe"

This example extends ["The Universe" (**TUNI**)](#the-universe) with the concept of
["DataVerse" (**DAVE**)](../extension/dataverse/README.md), so "The Universe" can behave as a collection
of [Data Spaces](../glossary/README.md#dataspace).

But the story does not stop here - but combines "The Multiverse", populated by given universes
"The Universe" and the "Parallel Universe" (**PUNI**), also with "DataVerse"-tech to host all known
[Data Spaces](../glossary/README.md#dataspace)...

```#tuni-dataverse, #dataverse, #tuni```
