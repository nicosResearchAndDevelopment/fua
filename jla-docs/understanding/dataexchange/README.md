# Understanding "Data Exchange"

## Introduction

To be precise: here we are focussed on [data](../../glossary/README.md#data) exchanged on
the [Application Layer](../../glossary/README.md#application-layer).

"Data Exchange" (maybe better called _[Information](../../glossary/README.md#information) Exchange_, but we leave it the
way it is...) ...is the main topic why [services](../../glossary/README.md#service) are up-and-running
as [Service Instances](../../glossary/README.md#service-instance).

"Data Exchange" is the process of _exchanging data_ and leads to [activity](../../glossary/README.md#activity)
_data-exchanging_ (exchanging).

Someone has not to be too _detailed_ to say: "Even the request is a data-exchange!". This is correct.

But...

## fua is focused on the provider

[Alice](../../glossary/README.md#alice):

> "Bob, clear the table!"

_Alice wants [Bob](../../glossary/README.md#bob) to clear the table_.

At this point Alice (as she marked out herself to the [controller](../../glossary/README.md#controller), sending a
[control](../../glossary/README.md#control), containing a [command](../../glossary/README.md#command) makes a _request_,
unambiguous information, targeted to Bob.

[Bob](../../glossary/README.md#bob):

>

_Bob, saying nothing and nothing happens_.

Nothing happens, Bob does not understand the request. Even there was some _data exchange_.

Next trial.

Alice:

> "Bob, open a beer and share it with me!"

_Alice is thirsty and likes to drink a beer, so she instructs Bob to open a bottle of beer and share it with her_.

Bob:

> "Fine! You're welcome! ...here's the mug!"

_Bob understood Alice's request and confirms the request while answering. A minute later he gives Alice what she has
wanted_.

Aside from the fact, that Bob acts here as a [provider](../../glossary/README.md#provider) (
see: [Bob](../../glossary/README.md#bob)) - one of those rare
moments - the _real_ exchange is the mug, filled with beer. It is the _main payload_.
