# `fua` DataVerse

The "DataVerse" (**DAVE**) model as a container for [Data Domains](#data-domain), [Data Spaces](#data-space),
and [Eco System](#eco-system).

The namespace prefix of "DataVerse" is `dave`.

```#dataverse, #dave```

## Introduction

The "DataVerse", a collection of [Data Domains](#data-domain), [Data Spaces](#data-space),
and [Eco System](#eco-system).

It is populated by Infrastructure Services (depending on given Eco System),
like [Authentication Services](#authentication-service) and [Authorization Services](#authorization-service), or
Catalogues, Brokers (to be understood as _something_
like ["Yellow Pages", Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages)). And - completing the roundel - Logging
Services and Clearing Houses.

Other Services, bring one [Eco System](#eco-system) or [Data Space](#data-space) to life, are those (evolving the main
topic ["Data Exchange"](../glossary/README.md#data-exchange) on
the ["Payload Data"](../glossary/README.md#payload-data) Layer) acting
under well known [roles](../glossary/README.md#role) ["Data Provider"](../glossary/README.md#data-provider)
and/or ["Data Consumer"](../glossary/README.md#data-consumer).

## Data Domain

```#data-domain```

---

## Eco System

```#eco-system```

---

## Data Space

A given "Data Space" (_the_ Data Space) is brought to life by a dynamic landscape of [data](../glossary/README.md#data)
and acts on top of underlying [Data Domain(s)](#data-domain), the infrastructure components, providing services boot
given Eco System and those normative rules, models, schemata and basic mechanics stated by _this_ Eco System with the
help of the [Identity Provider](#identity-provider).

```#data-space```

### Identity Provider

The Identity Provider (**IdP**) **MAY** consist of two Authorities ([Certification Body](#certification-body) and
[Certificate Authority](#certificate-authority)) and [identity providing services](#identity-providing-services),
tailored in [Authentication Service](#authentication-service) and [Authorization Service](#authorization-service).

```#identity-provider, #idp```

#### Certification Body

```#certification-body, #cb```

---

#### Certificate Authority

```#certificate-authority, #ca```

---

#### Identity Providing Services

##### Authentication Service

```#authentication-service```

##### Authorization Service

```#authorization-service```
