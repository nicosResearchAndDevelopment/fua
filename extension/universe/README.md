# `fua` Universe

The "Universe" Ontology, extending [`fua`](../../README.md).

The namespace prefix of "Universe" is `univ`.

## Introduction

`fua` uses "Universe" to show basic extension mechanisms (in `fua`). It is a _naive_ attempt to describe astronomical
"things" this way, but: at the end it will find its usage in given
example ["The Universe"](../example/universe/README.md), a basic demonstration
of [data](../glossary/README.md#data) design.

To feel free, while modelling and designing data, `fua` does **NOT** follow _correct_ and more
precise [ontologies](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/terms?q=astronomy) - as a starting point.

If `fua` has to solve some problems of bringing a Black Hole into service (**BHaaS**), than it will be the right time
to find an ontology it will ground on.

"Yes", it is nerdy. But things get more and more **serious** and the use cases less _weird_ the nearer we come
to Earth...
